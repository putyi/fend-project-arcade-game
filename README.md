### What for
This project is part of frontend web developer nanodegree at Udacity. The aim of this code is to use object-oriented java script programming, classes, prototype functions, constructor functions and to create objects with the "new" keyword. Keyword 'this' is used appropriately within the class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

###Playing the game
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down with the arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy,the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square losing one life. Once the player reaches the water, the number of lifes increases. If the player loses all its lives, the game is over and if nr. of lives increases to five, the game is won.
